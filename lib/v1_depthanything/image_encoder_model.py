class DinoV2Model4Stages(nn.Module):
    """
    Simplified implementation of the DINOv2 image encoder of Depth-Anything.
    The original model architecture comes from:
        "DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision"
        By: Maxime Oquab, Timothée Darcet, Théo Moutakanni et al.
        @ https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193

    The code here is derived from the Depth-Anything copy of the dinov2 repo:
        @ https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/tree/e7ef4b4b7a0afd8a05ce9564f04c1e5b68268516/torchhub/facebookresearch_dinov2_main

    The original dinov2 code repo can be found here:
        @ https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2

    This implementation removes most of the flexibility as well as training-specific elements
    of the original model, for the sake of readability. It has also been modified specifically
    for use in the DPT model architecture for depth estimation, originally proposed in the
    paper "Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction":
        @ https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413

    Note that unlike the original DPT models, this model does not output intermediate tokens
    from the transformers, instead it outputs the last 4 (consecutive) blocks!
